# FunProjects
This repository contains a sampling of fun projects I have completed over time.

Jupyter Notebooks - Fun/interesting analysis using Jupyter notebooks. Most notably, I use a Natural Language Processing model to determine if the song "Take Me Home, Country Roads" by John Denver is a song worthy of "banger" status.

GoodVibes - The start of an idea that is ongoing and will be added to in the future.

Fantasy Football - contains a Python program to screen scrape the FantasyPros website and pull auction values for all players. It is then loaded into a SQL Server database.

AI - contains a 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon solver and a stack vs queue comparison for solving a maze.
